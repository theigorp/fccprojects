                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),<br>JavaScript can be connected
                    to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                    of language elements such as operators, control structures, and<br>statements. Core JavaScript
                    can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                        and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side<br>extensions allow an
                        application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                        clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow<br>an application to
                        communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another
                        of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
                    The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static<br>typing and strong
                    type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it<br>was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing<br>numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based<br>model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative<br>requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                    variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with<br>whether methods are
                    public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly<br>typed.
